- [ ] Roll multiple die at once
- [ ] Actual dice pictures show up instead of numbers
- [ ] The dice look animated and spin or whatever before displaying number
- [ ] Add sfx

## Setup/Build
This project uses React Native, so it should be multiplatform (probably)  
Follow these instructions to download react native: 
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup  
If it's set up properly, you should be able to type `$ expo start`, and then 
select your testing environment
